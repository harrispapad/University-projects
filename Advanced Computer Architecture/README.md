# Advanced Computer Architecture

This directory contains coursework and projects for the Advanced Computer Architecture course.

## Contents

### Branch Prediction (`branch_prediction/`)
First assignment focusing on implementing and evaluating various branch prediction techniques. The assignment involved:
- Implementing different branch predictors using Intel Pin tools
- Running SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks to measure predictor performance
- Analyzing MPKI (Misses Per Kilo Instructions) and IPC (Instructions Per Cycle) metrics
- Comparing predictor accuracy across different benchmark workloads

Contains helper code, benchmark outputs, and final report.

### Memory Hierarchy (`memory_hierarchy/`)
Second assignment focusing on cache replacement policies and memory hierarchy optimization. The assignment involved:
- Implementing and comparing different cache replacement policies (LRU, LFU, Random, LIP, SRRIP)
- Simulating cache behavior using Intel Pin tools
- Running SPEC benchmarks to evaluate cache performance
- Analyzing cache miss rates and overall system performance

Contains helper code, experimental results for each replacement policy, and final report.
