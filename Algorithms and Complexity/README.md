# Algorithms and Complexity

This directory contains coursework for the Algorithms and Complexity course, divided into theoretical (analytical) and programming assignments.

## Contents

### Αναλυτικές (Theoretical Assignments)
Three sets of analytical problem sets focusing on algorithm design, analysis, and complexity theory. Each set includes the problem statements and solutions covering topics like algorithm correctness proofs, complexity analysis, NP-completeness, and optimization techniques.

### Προγραμματιστικές (Programming Assignments)
Competitive programming-style problems implemented in C++.

#### 1η Σειρά (Programming Set 1)
- **Bicriteria MST**: Finding minimum spanning trees with two optimization criteria
- **Line Market**: Optimization problem involving market placement on a line

Each problem includes solution code and comprehensive test cases.

#### 2η Σειρά (Programming Set 2)
- **Chem**: Chemistry-related algorithmic problem
- **Réveillon**: New Year's Eve scheduling/optimization problem

Each problem includes solution code, Makefile, automated testing scripts, and 20 test cases.

#### 3η Σειρά (Programming Set 3)
- **Shortcuts**: Graph shortest path problem with shortcut edges

Includes solution code and extensive test cases.
