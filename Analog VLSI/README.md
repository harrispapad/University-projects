# Analog VLSI

This directory contains the course project for Analog VLSI Design, focused on implementing an Analog Bayesian Classifier circuit.

## Contents

### Project Overview
Design and implementation of an analog Bayesian classifier using VLSI circuits. The project involved:
- Designing analog computational circuits for Bayesian classification
- Implementing winner-take-all (WTA) circuits
- Creating current mirror and operational amplifier circuits
- Performing parametric sweeps to optimize circuit performance
- Analyzing classification accuracy

### Circuit Designs (`drawings/`)
SVG diagrams of the designed circuits:
- Bump circuit
- Cascode current mirror
- Complete classifier architecture
- OpAmp current mirror
- Winner-take-all (WTA) circuit

### Simulation Results (`plots/`)
Analysis scripts and data from circuit simulations:
- Python scripts for plotting bias current, control voltage, and mean voltage sweeps
- CSV data from parametric sweeps (ibias, vc, vmean)
- Accuracy analysis over 20 iterations
- Excel data for final results
