### Weekly Lab Assignments (week_1 - week_8)

Progressive laboratory exercises covering microcontroller programming and interfacing:

1. **Week 1**: Introduction to PIC18 assembly programming - basic operations and program structure
2. **Week 2**: Assembly and C programming - mixed-language programming, data manipulation
3. **Week 3**: C programming fundamentals - I/O operations and control structures
4. **Week 4**: Hardware setup and peripheral configuration - timer/counter initialization
5. **Week 5**: I2C/TWI communication - LCD interface via port expander
6. **Week 6**: Advanced I2C applications - extended LCD control and TWI protocols
7. **Week 7**: Multi-protocol communication - USART serial, One-Wire interface (OWI), temperature sensors
8. **Week 8**: Integrated systems - combining multiple communication protocols

Each week's folder contains:

- MPLAB X project files
- Assembly (.asm) and C (.c) source code
- Compiled hex files for microcontroller programming
- Setup/library files for peripherals (LCD, TWI, USART, OWI)
- Assignment descriptions (PDF)
- Lab reports documenting implementation and results

### Development Environment

- MPLAB X IDE
- PIC18 microcontroller family
- Hardware interfaces: LCD displays, I2C devices, temperature sensors, USART communication
