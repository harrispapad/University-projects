- Process communication and coordination
- Command-line argument processing

Includes exercises on process trees, file searching utilities, and basic inter-process communication.

### 2η Σειρά (Assignment Set 2)

Multithreading and synchronization with POSIX threads:

- Pthread creation and management
- Synchronization primitives: mutexes, semaphores, condition variables
- Mandelbrot set parallel computation
- Thread synchronization patterns
- Avoiding race conditions and deadlocks

Includes exercises on parallel Mandelbrot rendering with various synchronization techniques.

### 3η Σειρά (Assignment Set 3)

Advanced synchronization and inter-process communication:

- Semaphores for process synchronization
- Shared memory between processes
- Signal handling
- Advanced parallel programming patterns

Contains two sub-assignments (3.1 and 3.2) with reports and implementations.
