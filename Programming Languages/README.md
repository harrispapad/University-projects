# Programming Languages

This directory contains three assignments for the Programming Languages course, each implementing the same problems across multiple programming paradigms to compare different approaches.

## Contents

### Assignment 1 (`exer24-1.pdf`)

**Fair Sequence Problem** - Implemented in multiple languages:

- **C/C++** (`1η Σειρά/1η/`): Imperative implementation with `fair.c` and `fairseq.cpp`
- **Standard ML** (`ml/1/`): Functional implementation in `fair.sml`
- **Python** (`python/`): Scripting approach in `fair.py`

Problem: Determining fair sequences with specific constraints.

### Assignment 2 (`exer24-2.pdf`)

**Tree Traversal and Analysis** - Implemented in multiple languages:

- **C++** (`1η Σειρά/2η/`): Object-oriented tree implementation
- **Java** (`java/tree/`, `java/tree_submission/`): Full OOP implementation with `Tree.java`, `Node.java`, and `InputReader.java`
- **Standard ML** (`ml/2/`): Functional tree processing in `fair.sml`

Problem: Tree data structure operations and traversal algorithms.

### Assignment 3 (`exer24-3.pdf`)

**Grid Traversal and Graph Problems** - Implemented in multiple paradigms:

- **Java** (`java/Grid/`, `java/Gridtraversal/`): Grid traversal with BFS/DFS algorithms
- **Prolog** (`prolog/Programming Languages/gridtraversal/`): Logic-based grid traversal in `grid_traversal.pl`
- **Python** (`python/lab/`): Goat crossing puzzle solver (`goat.py`)

Additional problems in Prolog (`prolog/`):

- Minimum bases problem (`minbases.pl`)
- Classic AI problems: factorial, queens, tic-tac-toe, wolf-goat-cabbage puzzle, zebra puzzle

### Additional Materials

- **BFS Example** (`java/BFS - example/`): Breadth-First Search solver for state space problems (Goat puzzle)
- **Standard ML utilities** (`ml/`): GPS, rotation, file parsing utilities
- **Prolog lab exercises** (`prolog/Programming Languages/lab/`): Various logic programming exercises
