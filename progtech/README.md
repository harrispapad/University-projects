# Programming Techniques (progtech)

This directory contains advanced C++ programming exercises focusing on algorithms, data structures, and the Standard Template Library (STL).

## Contents

### STL (`STL/`)
Exercises on C++ Standard Template Library:
- Containers (vector, list, map, set, etc.)
- Iterators and algorithms
- STL best practices

### Problem Solving
- **`babyratio/`**: Mathematical ratio problems
- **`dumb/`**: Algorithm implementation exercises
- **`random/`**: Random number generation and applications

### Course Materials
- **`lectures/`**: Lecture notes and materials
- **`palia/`**: Past exercises and exam problems (παλιά = old in Greek)

This course builds upon introductory programming, focusing on more advanced C++ techniques, object-oriented programming principles, and efficient use of the Standard Template Library.
